 Description :  Low-level tracing API
 Maintainer  :  Ian Duncan
 Stability   :  experimental
 Portability :  non-portable (GHC extensions)

 Traces track the progression of a single request, called a trace, as it is handled by services that make up an application. The request may be initiated by a user or an application. Distributed tracing is a form of tracing that traverses process, network and security boundaries. Each unit of work in a trace is called a span; a trace is a tree of spans. Spans are objects that represent the work being done by individual services or components involved in a request as it flows through a system. A span contains a span context, which is a set of globally unique identifiers that represent the unique request that each span is a part of. A span provides Request, Error and Duration (RED) metrics that can be used to debug availability as well as performance issues.

 A trace contains a single root span which encapsulates the end-to-end latency for the entire request. You can think of this as a single logical operation, such as clicking a button in a web application to add a product to a shopping cart. The root span would measure the time it took from an end-user clicking that button to the operation being completed or failing (so, the item is added to the cart or some error occurs) and the result being displayed to the user. A trace is comprised of the single root span and any number of child spans, which represent operations taking place as part of the request. Each span contains metadata about the operation, such as its name, start and end timestamps, attributes, events, and status.

 To create and manage 'Span's in OpenTelemetry, the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-opentelemetry-api OpenTelemetry API> provides the tracer interface. This object is responsible for tracking the active span in your process, and allows you to access the current span in order to perform operations on it such as adding attributes, events, and finishing it when the work it tracks is complete. One or more tracer objects can be created in a process through the tracer provider, a factory interface that allows for multiple 'Tracer's to be instantiated in a single process with different options.

 Generally, the lifecycle of a span resembles the following:

 A request is received by a service. The span context is extracted from the request headers, if it exists.
 A new span is created as a child of the extracted span context; if none exists, a new root span is created.
 The service handles the request. Additional attributes and events are added to the span that are useful for understanding the context of the request, such as the hostname of the machine handling the request, or customer identifiers.
 New spans may be created to represent work being done by sub-components of the service.
 When the service makes a remote call to another service, the current span context is serialized and forwarded to the next service by injecting the span context into the headers or message envelope.
 The work being done by the service completes, successfully or not. The span status is appropriately set, and the span is marked finished.
 For more information, see the traces specification, which covers concepts including: trace, span, parent/child relationship, span context, attributes, events and links.


 This module implements eveything required to conform to the trace & span public interface described
 by the OpenTelemetry specification.

 See OpenTelemetry.Trace.Monad for an implementation that's
 generally easier to use in idiomatic Haskell.

{- | Add an attribute to a span. Only has a useful effect on recording spans.

As an application developer when you need to record an attribute first consult existing semantic conventions for Resources, Spans, and Metrics. If an appropriate name does not exists you will need to come up with a new name. To do that consider a few options:

The name is specific to your company and may be possibly used outside the company as well. To avoid clashes with names introduced by other companies (in a distributed system that uses applications from multiple vendors) it is recommended to prefix the new name by your company’s reverse domain name, e.g. 'com.acme.shopname'.

The name is specific to your application that will be used internally only. If you already have an internal company process that helps you to ensure no name clashes happen then feel free to follow it. Otherwise it is recommended to prefix the attribute name by your application name, provided that the application name is reasonably unique within your organization (e.g. 'myuniquemapapp.longitude' is likely fine). Make sure the application name does not clash with an existing semantic convention namespace.

The name may be generally applicable to applications in the industry. In that case consider submitting a proposal to this specification to add a new name to the semantic conventions, and if necessary also to add a new namespace.

It is recommended to limit names to printable Basic Latin characters (more precisely to 'U+0021' .. 'U+007E' subset of Unicode code points), although the Haskell OpenTelemetry specification DOES provide full Unicode support.

Attribute names that start with 'otel.' are reserved to be defined by OpenTelemetry specification. These are typically used to express OpenTelemetry concepts in formats that don’t have a corresponding concept.

For example, the 'otel.library.name' attribute is used to record the instrumentation library name, which is an OpenTelemetry concept that is natively represented in OTLP, but does not have an equivalent in other telemetry formats and protocols.

Any additions to the 'otel.*' namespace MUST be approved as part of OpenTelemetry specification.
