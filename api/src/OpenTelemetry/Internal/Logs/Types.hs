  -- ^ Called when a LogRecord is emitted. This method is called synchronously on the thread that emitted the LogRecord, therefore it SHOULD NOT block or throw exceptions.
  --
  -- A LogRecordProcessor may freely modify logRecord for the duration of the OnEmit call. If logRecord is needed after OnEmit returns (i.e. for asynchronous processing) only reads are permitted.
  , logRecordProcessorShutdown :: IO (Async ShutdownResult)
  -- ^ Shuts down the processor. Called when SDK is shut down. This is an opportunity for processor to do any cleanup required.
  --
  -- Shutdown SHOULD be called only once for each LogRecordProcessor instance. After the call to Shutdown, subsequent calls to OnEmit are not allowed. SDKs SHOULD ignore these calls gracefully, if possible.
  --
  -- Shutdown SHOULD provide a way to let the caller know whether it succeeded, failed or timed out.
  --
  -- Shutdown MUST include the effects of ForceFlush.
  --
  -- Shutdown SHOULD complete or abort within some timeout. Shutdown can be implemented as a blocking API or an asynchronous API which notifies the caller via a callback or an event.
  -- OpenTelemetry SDK authors can decide if they want to make the shutdown timeout configurable.
  , logRecordProcessorForceFlush :: IO ()
  -- ^ This is a hint to ensure that any tasks associated with LogRecords for which the LogRecordProcessor had already received events prior to the call to ForceFlush SHOULD be completed
  -- as soon as possible, preferably before returning from this method.
  --
  -- In particular, if any LogRecordProcessor has any associated exporter, it SHOULD try to call the exporterâ€™s Export with all LogRecords for which this was not already done and then invoke ForceFlush on it.
  -- The built-in LogRecordProcessors MUST do so. If a timeout is specified (see below), the LogRecordProcessor MUST prioritize honoring the timeout over finishing all calls. It MAY skip or abort some or all
  -- Export or ForceFlush calls it has made to achieve this goal.
  --
  -- ForceFlush SHOULD provide a way to let the caller know whether it succeeded, failed or timed out.
  --
  -- ForceFlush SHOULD only be called in cases where it is absolutely necessary, such as when using some FaaS providers that may suspend the process after an invocation, but before the LogRecordProcessor exports the emitted LogRecords.
  --
  -- ForceFlush SHOULD complete or abort within some timeout. ForceFlush can be implemented as a blocking API or an asynchronous API which notifies the caller via a callback or an event. OpenTelemetry SDK authors
  -- can decide if they want to make the flush timeout configurable.

  -- ^ A value containing the body of the log record. Can be for example a human-readable string message (including multi-line) describing the event in a free form or it can be a
  -- structured data composed of arrays and maps of other values. Body MUST support any type to preserve the semantics of structured logs emitted by the applications.
  -- Can vary for each occurrence of the event coming from the same source. This field is optional.
  --
  -- Type any
  --    Value of type any can be one of the following:
  --    - A scalar value: number, string or boolean,
  --    - A byte array,
  --    - An array (a list) of any values,
  --    - A map<string, any>.
  , logRecordAttributes :: LogAttributes
  -- ^ Additional information about the specific event occurrence. Unlike the Resource field, which is fixed for a particular source, Attributes can vary for each occurrence of the event coming from the same source.
  -- Can contain information about the request context (other than Trace Context Fields). The log attribute model MUST support any type, a superset of standard Attribute, to preserve the semantics of structured attributes
  -- emitted by the applications. This field is optional.
