synopsis:            Optional OpenTelemetry integration for Honeycomb
category:            OpenTelemetry

# complications of embedding Haddock markup inside cabal files, it is
# common to point users to the README.md file.

ghc-options:
  - -Weverything
  # missing-exported-signatures turns off the more strict -Wmissing-signatures. See https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/14794#ticket
  - -Wno-missing-exported-signatures
  # Requires explicit export lists for every module, a pain for large modules
  - -Wno-missing-export-lists
  # Requires explicit imports of _every_ function (e.g. '$'); too strict
  - -Wno-missing-import-lists
  # When GHC can't specialize a polymorphic function. No big deal and requires fixing underlying libraries to solve.
  - -Wno-missed-specialisations
  # See missed-specialisations
  - -Wno-all-missed-specialisations
  # Don't use Safe Haskell warnings
  - -Wno-unsafe
  # Warning for polymorphic local bindings. Don't think this is an issue
  - -Wno-missing-local-signatures
  # Don't warn if the monomorphism restriction is used
  - -Wno-monomorphism-restriction
  #  Cabal isn’t setting this currently (introduced in GHC 8.10)
  - -Wno-missing-safe-haskell-mode
  #  Cabal’s generate Path_*.hs doesn’t do this (fixed in https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7352)
  - -Wno-prepositive-qualified-module
  # Some tooling gives this error
  - -Wno-unused-packages
  # Warns on every single data declaration
